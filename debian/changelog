mint-y-theme (1.0.1) sarah; urgency=medium

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * Actually add the .gitignore
  * Fix the text color in some primary toolbar and header bar entries
  * sidebars: don't use symbolic icons in the Nemo or GtkFileChooser sidebars
  * quiet some warnings about gtkalpha
  * Add some basic theming for Nemo disk full indicators
  * Ensure we get a colored focus border on primary-toolbar/header-bar entries in the darker variation
  * Redo theming for gnome terminal
  * Recolor treeview headers to match the color used by cinnamon-settings headers. Also clean up the weird multi-color backgrounds in gtk2 treeviews
  * Add images for .wide pane separator handles
  * Make the titlebar assets match better to the metacity assets
  * info-bars: Use a red color for the warning info bar. This gives us back the red banner when nemo is open as root
  * Remove the strange white frame from around menus in the dark version of the gtk2 theme

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
